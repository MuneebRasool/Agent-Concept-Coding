## Overview
This repository demonstrates a multi-agent system that prioritizes tasks based on a universal relevance metric, \( R_i(t) \). Each agent (e.g., SpamAgent, EmailParsingAgent, ContentClassificationAgent) can contribute to task utility/cost fields, which are then aggregated into \( R_i(t) \).

## Universal Relevance
- **Formula**: \( R_i(t) = \alpha \cdot U_i(t) - \beta \cdot C_i(t) \)  
- **Usage**: The `TaskPrioritizationAgent` (or coordinator) recalculates `node.relevance` at each step using this formula.

## Multi-Agent Objective
The multi-agent system optimizes task prioritization using the following mathematical objective:

\[
\sum_{k \in agents} \sum_{v_i \in KG} \phi_k(v_i) R_i(t)
\]

### **Interpretation**
1. **Summation over agents (\( k \in agents \))**:
   - Each agent \( k \) contributes to the system's objective.
   - Agents apply their own weighting function \( \phi_k(v_i) \) to each task/node \( v_i \).

2. **Summation over the Knowledge Graph (\( v_i \in KG \))**:
   - The computation spans all nodes \( v_i \) in the knowledge graph (KG), representing tasks or information units.

3. **Weighting Function (\( \phi_k(v_i) \))**:
   - Represents how strongly a given agent \( k \) influences task \( v_i \).
   - Default: \( \phi_k(v_i) = 1.0 \) (equal weight for all agents).
   - Can be adjusted per agent (e.g., SpamAgent may weigh spam-related nodes more).

4. **Relevance Score (\( R_i(t) \))**:
   - The universal relevance score of task \( v_i \) at time \( t \).
   - Computed as \( R_i(t) = \alpha \cdot U_i(t) - \beta \cdot C_i(t) \).

### **Implementation in MultiAgentCoordinator**
- Each agent evaluates tasks, adjusting \( \phi_k(v_i) \) dynamically.
- The system computes the total weighted relevance sum to determine **global task prioritization**.
- Agents interact, influence relevance scores, and adapt via feedback mechanisms.

## LLM as Input
- Agents call the LLM to interpret text (e.g., extracting tasks, detecting spam).
- Parsed data updates `utility` or `cost` fields, which feed into \( R_i(t) \).
- The `TaskPrioritizationAgent` re-ranks tasks after each update.

## Dependency Activation
- A DAG in `KnowledgeGraph` stores task dependencies.
- `update_task_actionability(kg)` checks if a task’s parents are completed:
  - If not complete, increase cost to lower its ranking.
  - Once parents finish, the child’s cost drops, making it actionable.

## Learning from Feedback
- `FeedbackLearningAgent` adjusts utilities or \( \alpha, \beta \) based on user actions:
  - Marking “not spam” raises utility or lowers cost.
  - Deferring certain tasks lowers utility.

## Spam Handling
- `SpamAgent` uses a logistic function to estimate spam probability.
- If `p_spam > 0.5`, utility is set low or cost is set high, effectively dropping \( R_i(t) \) to near zero.
- User feedback can override spam classifications.

## Critical Path
- `critical_path_dag()` finds the path with the maximum sum of \( R_i(t) \).
- This identifies a high-priority sequence of tasks in the DAG.

## Multi-Agent Coordination
- Each `Agent` subclass has a `step()` method and a custom `phi_k(node)` for specialized weighting.
- `MultiAgentCoordinator` runs all agents, aggregates their outputs, and handles conflict resolution (e.g., spam vs. user override).

## Emergent Mixed-Initiative
- As new tasks arrive (e.g., from LLM parsing), relevance updates on the fly.
- The user’s feedback influences future prioritization in a continuous loop.

## Code
Muneeb has conceptual Python code illustrating:
- Agents (`step()` methods, logistic spam detection, DAG logic).
- A universal \( R_i(t) \) approach.
- Feedback handling for adaptive \( \alpha, \beta \).
